## Encrypting your data

There are three states of data: data in transit (when it flows through the network), data in use 
(when it's actively being read and modified) and data at rest (when it's in stable storage). In the 
previous chapter, we discussed securing your data in transit using TLS 1.2 and strong 
encryption. In this chapter, we will focus on securing your data at rest.

Some data is intrinsically public, such as a press release. In contrast, some data is very private, 
such as healthcare, financial and personally identifying information. Part of any security 
consideration is the notion of "defense in depth": Even if your servers are protected (physically 
and virtually), you must still consider the case that someone will be able to get their hands on 
your data.

RavenDB supports strong encryption (`XChaCha20Poly1305` with a 256 bit key) to allow for full 
and transparent protection of your entire database. This feature ensures that nothing 
unencrypted is ever written to the disk, and that even in memory, outside of a running 
transaction, everything is encrypted.

In many industries, data encryption is a regulatory requirement. (PCI and HIPAA come to mind.) Even if an application doesn't require it, encryption is a fairly routine request that can provide 
you with the benefit of additional safety. Encrypting data at rest doesn't replace other security 
measures (such as limiting access to your database, encrypting the communication lines, 
protecting your access credentials, etc.) but it does complement them.

The major advantage of having encryption at the database level is that you don't need to 
change anything in your applications or clients. RavenDB will take care of this encryption 
behind the scenes—with no external changes for you to deal with. A user with access to this 
encrypted database can simply log in, query documents, modify them, etc., while RavenDB 
handles encrypting and decrypting the data as needed. RavenDB also requires all encrypted 
database access to use HTTPS, which takes care of the data in transit portion as well.

RavenDB goes to great lengths to ensure that on disk, and even in memory, your data is 
encrypted. In fact, the data is only decrypted when there is an active transaction—and even 
then, only the pieces that are touched by that transaction are left unprotected. Once the 
transaction is complete, RavenDB will zero the memory to erase the sensitive data.

Database encryption should be deployed as part of a comprehensive security strategy, including 
controlled access to the machines, a secure backup strategy (addressing security concerns with 
your high-availability and off-site deployment), management of your keys, and the appropriate 
audit and monitoring tools. This is a much wider topic than can be covered in this book, so I'll 
focus here only on the details of data encryption in RavenDB.

Before we get into the details, I want to be sure to mention that encryption has a cost. In terms 
of database performance, this cost is usually around 15% to 20%, depending on the exact load. 
In most cases, that's a reasonable price to pay for the additional security afforded. But there 
are also additional costs in managing encrypted databases: key management and backup, 
secure backups, being able to get the encryption key when you need to restore the database, 
etc.

Together, these can add up to significant operational overhead (as much as RavenDB strives to 
reduce it). I suggest confirming that you actually need the benefits of database encryption 
before using this feature in RavenDB, rather than just saying "encryption is good" and 
pressing forward needlessly.

To get started, we'll review how to define an encrypted database through the Studio. Then, 
we'll dive into what goes on behind the scenes and how RavenDB actively protects your data.

### Setting up an encrypted database

The first requirement of an encrypted database is that a cluster runs in a secure mode. There's 
no point in securing the data on disk if anyone on the network can see the data going in and 
out. In the previous chapter we reviewed the steps required for a such a setup, so we can skip 
the details here.

A database in RavenDB can be marked as encrypted when it's first created. You can see how 
this looks in the Studio in Figure 14.1.

![Creating an encrypted database](./Ch14/img01.png)

An encrypted database uses a 256 bit key to protect all its data. Without this key, the data only 
appears as random noise. (So, as you can imagine, your key is _important_. More on that later.) 
RavenDB's design also offers no way for a person to obtain the encryption key of an existing 
database. You'd have to know the key in advance. 

The properties of the key are also important. The key is a 256 bit value, generated using a 
cryptographically strong random number generator. While you _can_ provide your own key, in 
general, there is little reason to bother.

Regardless, you should be sure to keep a copy of the encryption key somewhere safe, so that 
you can access it and the database later on if needed. RavenDB makes such a decision explicit, 
as shown in Figure 14.2.

![The encryption configuration includes just the key and requires that you store a copy of it.](./Ch14/img02.png)

In RavenDB, you must confirm that you have a copy of the key saved somewhere. For 
convenience, RavenDB even lets you print the key and its QR code. The idea is that you can 
print this page and then file it away in a locked cabinet somewhere—as even the most 
sophisticated computer attack will have a hard time reaching information stored on paper! 
Plus, a hard-copy backup is beyond easy as a protection step to implement.

Of course, many organizations already have policies for encryption key usage, storage and 
backup. Sometimes it's with a hardware security module. Sometimes it's using "vault" services 
such as Microsoft Azure Key Vault, Keywhiz or HashiCorp Vault. Whether part of a formal policy 
or not, you as the admin should ensure that there's a copy of the encryption key.

> **What can an admin do with the encryption key?**
>
> Given the emphasis I just placed on the admin holding a copy of the encryption key, you might think you'll be using

> machine is lost and you need to move the data elsewhere) or if you're adding a node to the encrypted database 
> group and want all the nodes to use the same key (which is suggested, but not required).

Another requirement for encrypted databases is that the admin _must_ select which nodes to 
include in the encrypted database group. Usually, RavenDB will select these nodes based on its own preferences.
But for encrypted databases, an admin must specify them directly. This distinction is designed to handle the cases 
where servers might have different security zones in the same cluster.

> 
> This is why admins must manually select the nodes that will participate. These nodes must be up and available 
> during the database's launch so that they can accept the new key.

Once the database is created, what I've described here is pretty much it—at least as far as 
deviations from the standard usage and configuration of databases are concerned.

### Full database encryption

Caesar, about 21 centuries ago, used a cipher to send messages securely, by shifting the letters 
of his messages by three characters. When most of the population was illiterate, this approach 
was probably sufficient by way of security. Today, the science of cryptography and 
cryptoanalysis is a _bit_ more sophisticated.

The goal of encryption is to take your input and a key, and then generate a random-looking 
pattern of bytes from it. This offers no way to go back to the original input without the key.  

But that's only part of what a good encryption scheme must deal with today. Modern 
cryptography should handle other things, such as the timing (and other side channels) of an 
attack, forward secrecy, authenticated encryption and many other details that are crucial for 
the security of the system but tend to be rather obtuse, onerous and obscure to non-experts.

RavenDB uses Daniel J. Bernstein's `XChaCha20Poly1305` algorithm to encrypt your databases, 
as implemented by the `libsodium` library. Both the algorithm and the library have been analyzed 
and audited by cryptographic experts. Both passed with flying colors. 

I'm not going to discuss the actual encryption algorithm here, which would be quite out of scope for this 
book. You can find the gory details elsewhere. But I am going to focus on the way RavenDB 
uses encryption to protect your data. You can safely skip this section if you'd like, as it has a 
very little impact on using and operating RavenDB.

Internally, RavenDB holds your data inside a data file (usually called `Raven.voron`) that's 
memory-mapped to the RavenDB process. We also use temporary files^[These files are 
also memory-mapped, but they aren't persistent, as far as RavenDB is concerned.
Instead, we are using memory-mapped files to avoid using too much private memory and give the 
operating system well-known backing store for this temporary memory. It also allows RavenDB to 
have fine-grained control over the memory usage required by the storage requirements.], which are
typically found in in the Temp directory and have names such as: 
`Temp/scratch.0000000000.buffers` and `Temp/compression.0000000000.buffers`. 
There are also the write-ahead journals, which 
are the key to RavenDB's transactional nature and ACID capabilities. These are stored in the 
Journals directory with names such as `Journals/0000000000000000001.journal` and 
`Journals/0000000000000000002.journal`.

All these files contain some portion of your document data. As such, they need to be encrypted. 
Let's see how we deal with encrypting each of them in turn in the next section.

#### Encrypting the write-ahead journal

The write-ahead journal is a set of files (`Journals/0000000000000000001.journal`, `Journals/0000000000000000002.journal`, 
etc.) that RavenDB uses to maintain its ACID guarantees. Each journal file is allocated in advance (typically 256 MB at a time), and a new transaction is written to the file whenever it's committed. Indeed, a transaction cannot be 
considered committed unless it's been successfully written to the journal 
file.^[RavenDB uses direct and unbuffered I/O to write to the disk, ensuring 
that writes are persistent, skipping the caches in the middle.] 

A journal file is a set of consecutive transactions. When RavenDB opens a database, it will read 
the journal file, find all the transactions that haven't yet been synced to disk and apply them to 
the data file. In this way, we can be certain—even after a crash—that no data has been lost. 
Without encryption, a transaction is protected using a non-cryptographic hash (`XXHash64`) to 
ensure that the full transaction has been written to disk. This lets us verify whether a 
transaction was committed or not.

During encryption, we store only the transaction header unencrypted in the journal file. The 
transaction data itself is encrypted using `XChaCha20Poly1305`. This is an authenticated 
encryption algorithm, giving us cryptographic assurance that if the decryption was successful, 
the data we got matches the data we encrypted. Since we're already verifying the integrity of 
the data, we don't bother also using `XXHash64` on the transaction when using encryption. Each 
transaction is encrypted with a different key, derived from the master key, the transaction ID 
and a 192 bit random nonce.

#### Encrypting the main data file

The main data file (`Raven.voron`) contains all the data in your database. Unlike the journals, 
which are written to in a consecutive manner—one transaction at a time—the data file is 
written to and read from using random I/O. To handle this mode of operations, the data file is 
split into 8 KB pages^[There are a lot of other reasons why the data is divided into pages,
and this is how RavenDB works without encryption as well. It just happens that it also plays 
very nicely into the requirements for using the data while keeping it encrypted.] that can be 
treated as independent of one another. If there's a value over 8 KB in size, then the file will
use as many consecutive pages as needed and will be treated as a single page.

Each page is encrypted independently. This means that when we need to read a page, we can 
go directly to that page, decrypt it and read its content without having to touch anything else in 
the database. This process grants us the ability to do random reads and writes through the 
database. The structure of a page is shown in Figure 14.4.

![The internal structure of an encrypted page in RavenDB](./Ch14/img04.png)

As you can see in Figure 14.4, the page is composed of a header, nonce, MAC and the data 
itself. You're already familiar with the nonce. But what is the MAC field for? This is the message 
authentication code, which is used to verify that the page hasn't been modified (see the section 
on authentication encryption earlier in this chapter). Another interesting tidbit is that the space 
we have for the nonce is only 128 bits (16 bytes), but we know that the `XChaCha20Poly1305` 
algorithm uses a 192 bit (24 bytes) nonce. Listing 14.1 shows what's actually going on.


```{caption="Internal structure of the page header and the full nonce usage"}
+--------+
|Page    |
|Header  |
|        |
|32 bytes| <-------+
+--------+         |
|Nonce   |      Actual nonce
|16 bytes|         |24 bytes
+--------+ <-------+
|MAC     |
|16 bytes|
+--------+
```

When RavenDB needs to encrypt a page, it will generate a 128 bit random value and store it in 
the nonce portion of the page header. However, when we need to pass a nonce to 
`XChaCha20Poly1305`, we will pass a value that is 24 bytes in size, starting 8 bytes before the nonce. In 
other words, the nonce also contains 8 bytes from the page header. In practice, this means that the 
nonce is using 128 bits of randomness with an additional 64 bits that will change as RavenDB 
sees fit.

Each page is encrypted using a dedicated key, derived from the master key and the page 
number. The page header is stored unencrypted, of course, but the page's contents are 
encrypted.

#### How does RavenDB access encrypted data?

RavenDB keeps all the data in the database encrypted at all times, both on disk and in memory. 
Whenever a transaction requires access to a particular page, that page is decrypted into 
memory owned by that transaction. For the duration of the transaction, the unencrypted values 
touched by this transaction will be kept in memory. When the transaction is over, that memory 
will be securely wiped.

To further protect your data, RavenDB will attempt to lock the unencrypted data in memory, so 
that it will not be written to a page file and will not be visible in core dumps. This is done by 
calling `mlock` or `VirtualLock`, depending on the system in question.

Locking memory into physical RAM is subject to certain limitations and may require you to 
change the system configuration to let RavenDB lock enough memory to handle routine 
operations. If your threat model doesn't include worrying about attackers digging into the page 
file, you can tell RavenDB that failing to lock memory is fine by using the following configuration 
option: `Security.DoNotConsiderMemoryLockFailureAsCatastrophicError`.

This might be a valid choice if the system doesn't have a swap or page file defined, for example, 
or if you're using encrypted swap already and don't need to worry about data leaks from there.

RavenDB also uses a few temporary files `Temp/scratch.0000000000.buffers` and 
`Temp/compression.0000000000.buffers`, for example). In terms of encryption, there are 
two types that we care about. First are the `scratch` files, which is where RavenDB writes your 
data to until it's written to the data file. These files are encrypted in the exact same way as the 
data file itself. Whenever you need to access data from one of these files, they're decrypted on 
temporary storage during the transaction and then wiped after it's completed.

> RavenDB doesn't generally log documents' data to the log file, even when set to the most detailed mode, but it can certainly 
> write document IDs in certain cases. If document IDs themselves are sensitive data, you should either ensure that 
> the logs directory is encrypted or disable logging entirely.

The other set of files are used as temporary buffers and are wiped immediately after use. The 
`compression` set of files, for example, is used as part of writing to the journal. We write the 
transaction data to the memory-mapped compression file and then compress, encrypt and 
write it to the disk. Once that's done, we securely wipe the compression file to remove all 
traces of your data from memory.

So, what's encrypted, you ask? Everything stored in the database file. This includes:

* Documents
* Revisions
* Conflicts
* Attachments
* Tombstones

What's _not_ encrypted? Values that are stored at the cluster level. These are:

* Identities
* Compare exchange values
* The database record

Identities aren't generally considered sensitive information. But compare exchange values most 
certainly can contain data you'll want to keep private. Most important, the database record 
might contain connection strings to other databases. This is relevant only if you're using ETL 
SQL and providing the password in the connection string. In that case, the full connection string 
is stored at the cluster level and is not affected by your database's encryption mode.

To enable encryption at the cluster level, you'll need to take additional steps, as we'll see now.

#### Encrypting the cluster information

In addition to storing your database-level data, RavenDB also stores data at the cluster level. 
This is usually called the server store and is managed independently by any node in the cluster. 
The data stored there includes all the database records, identities, compare exchange values, 
etc. These are stored in all the nodes in the clusters, including for databases that don't reside on 
this particular node.

You can also encrypt the information on the server store. Although, doing so is a bit more 
involved than the process of encrypting a database, and you must repeat this operation on _all_
the nodes in the cluster. Here's how:

1. Shut down the RavenDB node.
2. Run `rvn offline-operation encrypt /path/to/system-db`.
3. Restart the RavenDB node.

The key here is in the second step. This action loads the existing server store (which typically 
resides in the `System` directory), generates a new key (see the section on key management 
later in this chapter) and then encrypts the server store using this key.

This process should be done on all the nodes in the cluster, and it will typically result in a 
different key being generated for each node. Note that RavenDB does _not_ enforce system store 
encryption on every node. This is to allow for a rolling migration of encrypting the system store 
(taking one node at a time, encrypting it and restarting it). 

If you do decide to encrypt your system store, make sure to involve all nodes in the cluster—including 
when you are adding _new_ nodes. You can also run the `rvn offline-operation encrypt`
command before adding any new nodes to the cluster so that it won't ever write unencrypted 
data to the disk.

#### Encrypting indexes

In addition to the main data file, there are indexes to consider. Each index has a separate 
`Raven.voron` file, its own `Scratch` and `compression` files, etc. And just like the main data 
file, indexes are encrypted on all levels, using the exact same techniques we just discussed.

During queries, the indexing transaction decrypts the relevant pages so that you can perform 
searches normally. It then wipes the data from the memory when the query is completed. 
There's one exception to this rule: in memory caches that the indexing engine uses for optimization purposes.

These caches contain the indexed terms as memory arrays and are kept outside the transaction 
boundary. This is because creating them can be quite expensive, in terms of time and number of allocations.
Because of that, they are created once and retained for as long as they are useful. They're never written to the 
disk, but they might be written to the page file. 

If you're concerned about the safety of this type of data, either make sure your page file or 
swap is encrypted or don't index any sensitive information. (There's rarely a need to run a 
query using a full credit card number, for example; the last four digits will usually suffice.) 
Document data that hasn't been indexed isn't included in the cache!

During indexing, we also write temporary files to the indexing directory, containing the indexed 
data. These files are also encrypted using `XChaCha20Poly1305`, with a random key RavenDB 
generates.

Even index _definitions_ are encrypted. So, you can rest assured with RavenDB that everything 
going to a persistent medium is encrypted and safe. 

Now, what about what goes on the network?

### Encrypted data on the wire

Different nodes in the cluster may use different keys to encrypt the database. That means that 
we can't just send raw encrypted data from one node to another. Indeed, whenever RavenDB 
sends data over the network—whether as a response to a client's query or to replicate data for 
another node—we must first decrypt the data before sending it.

This may sound worrisome, but remember that an encrypted database can only reside on a 
node that's running in a secured mode—in other words, all communication uses HTTPS and TLS 
1.2 and is both strongly encrypted and authenticated. Let's explore a few of the ways this is put 
into practice.

Aside from a client querying the database, there are few other ways to get data from RavenDB. 
Replication, external replication and ETL are the most common ones. Backups should also be 
considered; these are handled later in this chapter.

Replication is for different database instances in the same database group—all of them will be 
encrypted (usually, but not always, with the same key). See the key management section later 
in this chapter for more details. 

External replication lets us copy data to a different database, in either the same or a different 
cluster. While RavenDB requires that any external replication from an encrypted database go to 
a secure server, it does not require that the destination will be an encrypted database.

In addition to external replication, it's common to use ETL processes to extract data out of a 
RavenDB database. A good example is on a system that stores payment information. Given PCI^[Payment Card Industry.] 
compliance issues, data must be stored in an encrypted way. But imagine we set up the 
RavenDB ETL process on a separate database to let us work with the data more easily. In doing 
so, we removed the sensitive payment details and were effectively left with just the orders 
history. Since this (non-sensitive) information isn't required to be encrypted, it's left alone here. 
In the same way, we can also use ETL SQL to transfer some of the (non-sensitive) data to a reporting database 
for later analysis.

One thing to note at this point is that, while RavenDB will insist that the ETL process use a 
secure mode (HTTPS), we don't always have a good way to detect whether your ETL SQL connection 
string is itself encrypted. It's therefore the admin's responsibility to ensure that this 
communication channel is safe from eavesdropping. For that matter, regardless of whether 
your communication channel is encrypted, admins should be aware of the data flow inside the system. 
This will make sure that you aren't sending sensitive information into an unencrypted store, 
potentially exposing data that shouldn't be stored in plain text.^[You can force RavenDB to accept
ETL tasks that use non encrypted channels using the `AllowEtlOnNonEncryptedChannel` option.]

### Key management

This section is _important_. In fact, it's probably the most important aspect for an admin to read. 
This is because, to understand the security of the system, you ultimately need to be aware of 
where your keys are. You can encrypt your data using the strongest encryption methods, using 
post-quantum algorithms, for example. But in the end, everything still hinges on the security of 
your keys. If the key leaks in any way, it's game over for you as far as your system's security is 
concerned.

As you can imagine, we put a lot of thought into key management at RavenDB. And yet we 
recognize competing concerns here: The more secure your system is, the harder it is to use. 

As you've already seen earlier in this chapter, not much is required to set up an encrypted 
database using RavenDB. Our software generates a key for you automatically. So, aside from 
writing this key down, you can just sit back and let run everything normally. 

But this leads to an interesting question: Where is the key stored on our end, and how?

In fact, there isn't a key in the singular sense; there might be more than one. RavenDB uses the 
following two keys^[Both the database keys and the server master key are local to a node, 
not shared across the cluster.]:

* Database encryption key - a per-database key, used as the master encryption key for an 
  entire database and stored on the server store
* Server master key - a server-wide value used for encrypting the database encryption keys

By default, the server store as a whole is not encrypted. To prevent an attacker from simply reading the 
database encryption keys from the file system and then accessing your data, we encrypt the 
database encryption keys themselves _a second time_, using a server master key. 

Of course, you as a smart reader know that this just moves the attack vector. So, you may be 
wondering: How is the server master key then protected? 

While RavenDB could encrypt the server master key as well, doing so would just lead to a need 
for a third encryption key, and then a fourth. And if we encrypt that, then we'll discover that it's 
turtles all the way down. 

This isn't a problem that's unique or new to RavenDB. Your organization is also likely to have 
policies in place for protecting the encryption key: through safe storage. We'll discuss how 
RavenDB can fit into those policies later on. But for now, let's see how RavenDB stores the 
server master key by default.

On Windows, a data protection API (`DPAPI`) lets RavenDB piggyback the encryption of the key 
on top of a Windows password. (Conceptually, Windows uses a value derived from the logged-in user's password to encrypt or decrypt values.) This means that RavenDB doesn't even need a 
server master key; we can rely on `DPAPI` to manage things for us. 

So, whenever we need to store the database encryption keys for Windows, we'll call `DPAPI`, 
which will encrypt each key and store its encrypted value. Whenever we open an encrypted 
database, we'll hand the encrypted value back to `DPAPI` and get the key in return, which we 
can then use to open the encrypted database.

This process has the advantage of being pretty seamless and (usually) good enough as security. 
The disadvantage is that this security is tied to your Windows password.^[In this case,
the relevant password is for the user account that is running the RavenDB process. This account will 
usually not be for a normal user, but for a service account.] For example, an admin 
resetting a password will cause `DPAPI` to fail at decrypting any values encrypted with the old 
password. (Note that changing your password, which requires entering the current password, is 
safe in this regard. Only a password _reset_ will lose us access to previously encrypted `DPAPI` 
values.)

On Linux, the situation is a lot more complex. There isn't a single solution like `DPAPI` on Linux. 
Instead, there are many solutions that can be used: `libsecret`, `Gnome Keyring`, `KDE Vallet`, etc. 

Yet because there's no universally accepted approach—and to avoid dependencies that might 
not exist for all deployments—RavenDB doesn't use of any of these solutions for Linux (see the 
next section for how you can customize that). Instead, we use the operating system 
permissions to securely hold the key. This key is stored in the `~/.ravendb/secret.key` file 
with permissions set to only allow the RavenDB user access to it.

On Linux, if you have a single hard disk that stores both the `secret.key` file and the encrypted 
database, then you can plug it into a separate system where you have root privileges and skip 
any permissions checks on the file-system level. (On Windows, there are tools such as `DPAPick` 
that can decrypt `DPAPI` values, given offline access to a machine.)

So, by default, RavenDB uses these operating-system level mechanisms to secure the server 
master key. But recognizing that doing so gives you only up to a certain level of security, we let 
you customize the way in which RavenDB _gets_ the encryption key.

#### Customizing key management in RavenDB

Your master encryption key is the holy grail of your database security. RavenDB has reasonable 
defaults to store it—using DPAPI or file system permissions, depending on which operating 
system you're running on. But there's a limit to how much these methods can protect your 
data. In many organizations, there are strict security policies around key management, and 
RavenDB lets you follow them easily.

In much the same way that you can customize how RavenDB gets the `X509` certificate to ensure 
that your communication is safe, we also let you specify an executable that will fetch the key 
from some a secret store. This process is controlled using the `Security.MasterKey.Exec` 
configuration value.

Listing 14.2 shows an example of a PowerShell script that can be invoked to fetch the 
encryption key from Azure Vault.

```{caption="Getting the encryption key from Azure Vault and sending it to RavenDB" .ps1}
$secret = Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret -VaultName 'AllMySecrets' -Name 'RavenMasterEncKey'
$key = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($secret.SecretValueText)
$stdout = [System.Console]::OpenStandardOutput()
$stdout.Write($key, 0, $key.Length)
```
RavenDB will invoke this script, read the key from the standard output and use it as the server 
master key. In this way, you retain complete control over key storage, access control, etc.

Important to note is that failure to retrieve the server master key—or getting the wrong key—
will cause a failure to load any encrypted databases. And if the server store is encrypted, it will 
cause a failure to start RavenDB as well.

#### Managing the database encryption key

So far we've talked primarily about the server master key. But the database encryption key also 
deserves some attention. Earlier in this chapter, we walked through creating an encrypted 
database, and as part of that, we also got the encryption key to safely store away (Figure 14.2).

Encryption keys are not part of the global cluster state, nor are they usually sent over the wire.
Instead, at database creation time, the server generates a key and then contacts each of the 
nodes configured for hosting this database and tells them the key for this database. Only then is 
the actual database created.

If you created an encrypted database on Node A, and later you want to expand the database 
group to also reside on Node C, how does that work? After all, the encryption key isn't available 
on Node C. So, just trying to expand the database group there will result in an error, as setting 
up a key for an encrypted database is a separate action from setting up the database. 

The database creation wizard makes this process seamless. But it's important to understand 
what's going on beneath the surface.

Because different nodes don't necessarily have the same encryption key for the same 
database—and because the encryption key is _important_—we require an administrator action to 
create the key on a node before RavenDB loads an encrypted database. This can be done 
through a REST call, as you can see in Listing 14.3.

```{caption="Pushing a database encryption key to a node" .ps1}
$baseUrl = "https://c.raven.development.run"
$dbName = "Northwind"

$spm = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]
$spm::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
$rng = [System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider]
$key = New-Object byte[] 32
$rng::Create().GetBytes($key)
$payload = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($key)
$cert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath admin.cert.pfx

Invoke-WebRequest "$baseUrl/admin/secrets?name=$dbName" `
    -Certificate $cert -Method POST -Body $payload
```

There is actually a lot going on in Listing 14.3. First, we define which node we'll push the key to 
and which database whose encryption key we'll push. Then, we ask PowerShell to use TLS 1.2 to 
talk to the server. (Sometimes it defaults to TLS 1.0, which isn't supported by RavenDB for 
security reasons.) `RNGCryptoServiceProvider` is then used to generate a cryptographically 
secured random number. We convert it to Base64 and then use a certificate with cluster 
administrator privileges to send it to the node.

Once this is done, we can now expand the [What is "northwind?"] Northwind database from Node `A` to Node `C` as well. 
The database will be created on the new node, and the previously pushed encryption key will 
be in use. 

An admin can decide whether to use the same key on all nodes-—which may simplify some 
operations, such as restoring from backup—or to use different keys. We'll speak more about 
backup later in this book. But there are some things about backing up an encrypted database 
that require special attention here. Let's go over them.

### Backing up encrypted databases

Just because a database is encrypted doesn't mean that it doesn't need all the usual care and 
maintenance you give to other data. In particular, I'm thinking about backups, restores and 
high-availability considerations. 

We'll discuss backups in full in the next part of this book, so I'm won't get too deep into the 
details now of how to work with them. Instead, I'll just discuss the details that are important to 
remember when dealing with encrypted databases.

RavenDB supports the following forms of backups:


* Snapshot - a compressed binary view of the database files at a given point in time, as well 
  as additional data from the cluster level that belongs to the database (identities, compare 
  exchange values, etc.)
* Full backup - a compressed JSON of all data in the database, as well as the cluster-level data
  for this database
* Incremental backup - a compressed JSON of all data in the database since the last full backup, 
  as well as all the cluster-level data for this database

For an encrypted database, it's important to consider what parts of the backup are encrypted, 
and in what manner. With a Snapshot backup, the entire snapshot is encrypted using the 
database encryption key. Conceptually, you're getting the raw file from the disk—as is^[Note 
that this is just a conceptual model. You can't just copy the file out of the way while 
RavenDB is running and consider this a backup].

As a result, you _must_ have the appropriate encryption key if you ever want to restore the 
snapshot. Without this key, there's no way to restore the database, access the data or really do 
anything at all.

Alongside the snapshot data, there's also the cluster-level data. This set of data is typically 
much smaller, but it is _not_ encrypted in the case of a snapshot. While it is compressed, this data 
is available to anyone who can read the backup media.

Full and incremental backups are always completely unencrypted, so you should be aware of 
your backup strategy and where you'll back up your encrypted databases. RavenDB is equipped 
to push backups to a local or shared directory, to an FTP/SFTP site, to Azure Blob storage, to 
Amazon S3 and to Amazon Glacier.

In any of these cases, if you have an encrypted database, then you need to consider where you 
will store the data. You can back up to an encrypted folder, or you can enable data-at-rest 
encryption settings when uploading to the cloud (exactly how depends on which system you're 
using, but all have some level of support for automatic encryption of uploaded content).

We'll discuss backup management at length in Chapter 17. But I want to emphasize 
that, for encrypted databases, in addition to backing up the data for the document itself, it's 
important to have a copy of the encryption key. Not only is this step important for restoring 
snapshot data, but it also can be very relevant if an admin has ever reset a password for a user, 
resulting in `DPAPI` failure to decrypt the database encryption key at startup. 

This error can happen pretty far down the line. If the admin resets the password on Monday, 
but RavenDB had already gotten the encryption key in memory, then no issue will appear until 
the moment when RavenDB unloads the database and needs to reload it—potentially several 
days or weeks later. At that point, your being able to quickly and easily grab the encryption key 
from a locked drawer and provide it to RavenDB for loading the encrypted database is much 
preferred to a forced restore of everything.

### Summary

This chapter may be hard to _decipher_, but I hope you get the right _key_ points from it! In a more 
serious tone, we've gone over a lot of information about how RavenDB is using high-end 
encryption to safely protect your data. RavenDB uses the `XChaCha20Poly1305` algorithm to 
encrypt any and all data on disk, and we will only decrypt information during an active 
transaction. RavenDB will also immediately wipe the decrypted contents in memory upon 
transaction closure, reducing the time that sensitive information is available. During this time, 
the memory holding the decrypted data is also locked into memory, so it won't be written to a 
page file or a swap partition.

We went over the details of how RavenDB encrypts every part of the system, from how 
transactions are encrypted as they're written to the disk to how each individual page in the 
database is encrypted with its own unique key. We saw what's encrypted on RavenDB 
(documents, attachments, revisions) and what isn't—even if the database itself is encrypted 
(identities and compare exchange values). We then saw how we can encrypt cluster-level data 
by encrypting the server store and met for the first time the `rvn` tool.

After that, we looked at what's probably the most important topic for you in this chapter: how 
the encryption keys are being managed by RavenDB. By default, RavenDB encrypts the 
database encryption keys using the server master key. This master key is then either encrypted using 
`DPAPI` on Windows or protected using file system permissions on Linux. You also have the 
option of telling RavenDB how to fetch the master key from a hardware security module, a vault 
or any other method that fits your security policies, using the `Security.MasterKey.Exec` 
option.

Finally, we discussed backup concerns for encrypted databases, and in particular, the 
safekeeping of your encryption keys. I find it ironic that the most secure backup method is 
probably just printing a hard copy of the encryption key and storing it offline in a locked 
cupboard at your offices. But I've nonetheless found this approach to be one of the most 
efficient ways to handle the issue of a lost or stolen key. Having the key tucked away like this 
means that you won't have to think about it too much—but if you do have a need, the key is 
available to you.

You might have noticed some emphasis on my part on the topic of keeping the encryption key 
safe. This is because the key is _important_. Without it, you have zero access to the database. You 
may think this emphasis is obvious as a basic property of an encrypted database. And yet, we've 
gotten support calls with some variant of "we lost the key, how do we get the data back?". This 
scenario can occur due to a password reset invalidating a `DPAPI`-encrypted value, losing the 
main hard disk of the machine while still having the database drive up, or many other reasons.

Regardless of the cause, the key was lost. If there's no key, then 
there's no way to access your data. That is the _point_ of encryption! So, please remember that 
when you create an encrypted database, keep your encryption keys somewhere safe—just in 
the off case that you'll need them.

This chapter also closes our discussion on security inside RavenDB. The next topic on the table 
is an in-depth dive into operations, deployments and monitoring your production clusters.
